Compare two files 	diff -u first file second file
 it is a lot faster than searching manually

Git makes it easy to track changes and the times those changes were made would help make me a more efficient programmer by the ease in detecting errors.

Git allows saving multiple files in one commit because it was designed for code with the expectation that code will not just be one unit file, but a system of files.

Can use the git log and git diff commands to get a view of any changes that were made that i am unsure of.

Using version control would make me more confident making changes that could break code because I will always be able to go back to a state before the break.

I would like to use Git to control versions of the Arduino code I tweak frequently when i get a new idea.
